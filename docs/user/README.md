#User README Final Project

To use this product, simply insert the moisture sensor into the dirt of your plant, set up the servo that will pour water into the plant, and place the ultrasonic sensor over the water dispenser.

To manually water the plant, open up the app and click the water plant button. On that page there will also be a timer showing you when the last time the plant was watered that will reset every time the plant is watered, and a popup that will appear if the water is too low and the dispenser needs to be refilled.

To automatically water the plant, click on the settings button and turn on the auto water button. There you can adjust the desired moisture of your plant, and the smart watering system will automatically water your plant when the moisture level is below what you set. You can also set up an interval at which the watering system will automatically water your plant whenever the interval has passed. You can also manually water the plant with this feature turned on.

There is a safeguard feature where the automatic watering system must wait at least one minute before it can water the plant again since it takes time for the water to travel through the soil and for the sensor to read it.
